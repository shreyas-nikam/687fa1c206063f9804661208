## 1. Notebook Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive simulation of operational loss events within a hypothetical cryptocurrency exchange environment. It aims to illustrate the financial impact of different insurance-like mitigation strategies, such as self-insurance funds or traditional excess of loss policies.

### Learning Goals

Upon completing this notebook, users will be able to:
*   Understand common operational risk types prevalent in cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., system outages, security breaches, unauthorized trading, regulatory fines).
*   Learn how to model loss frequency and severity using statistical distributions.
*   Explore the practical impact of deductibles ($d$) and coverage limits ($c$) on retained losses for individual events and in aggregate.
*   Visualize the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies in reducing net financial exposure.
*   Gain insight into how concepts from the `PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook` [7], particularly the "Modeling Insurance Policies" section [8], are applied to real-world financial risk scenarios.

### Expected Outcomes

By interacting with this notebook, users will:
*   Generate synthetic datasets of operational loss events based on customizable parameters.
*   Apply a defined payout function to simulate insurance-like mitigation.
*   Calculate and compare gross, transferred, and retained losses.
*   Visualize loss dynamics through various plots (trend, relationship, aggregated comparison).

## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section lays the groundwork for understanding operational loss modeling and the impact of insurance mitigation strategies, drawing heavily from the principles outlined in the `PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook` [7, 8].

### 2.1 Operational Risk in Cryptocurrency Exchanges

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. In the context of cryptocurrency exchanges, this encompasses a unique set of challenges:
*   **System Outages**: Downtime due to technical failures, impacting trading and asset accessibility.
*   **Security Breaches**: Hacking incidents, phishing attacks, or unauthorized access leading to loss of digital assets.
*   **Unauthorized Trading**: Malicious or erroneous trades executed by internal personnel or external bad actors.
*   **Regulatory Fines**: Penalties incurred due to non-compliance with evolving cryptocurrency regulations (e.g., AML/KYC).
*   **Human Error**: Mistakes by employees leading to financial losses or system vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Loss Modeling

Operational losses are typically characterized by their **frequency** and **severity**.
*   **Loss Frequency ($N$)**: The number of loss events occurring within a specified period. This is often modeled using discrete probability distributions (e.g., Poisson distribution). For this simulation, we simplify by allowing the user to define a fixed number of events to simulate for demonstration.
*   **Loss Severity ($X_i$)**: The financial impact (amount) of an individual loss event $i$. Severity is typically modeled using continuous, heavy-tailed distributions to capture extreme loss events. Common choices include:
    *   **Lognormal Distribution**: Often used for financial losses due to its positive skewness and long tail. A loss event $X_i$ is Lognormally distributed if $\ln(X_i)$ is Normally distributed. It is defined by its mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the underlying normal distribution.
    *   **Pareto Distribution**: Another heavy-tailed distribution, particularly suitable for modeling phenomena where there are many small occurrences and a few very large ones (e.g., large operational losses). It is defined by its scale ($x_m$) and shape ($\alpha$) parameters.
    *   **Exponential Distribution**: A simpler distribution representing the time between events in a Poisson process, or in this context, serving as a basic severity distribution with a constant rate ($\lambda$).

### 2.3 Insurance Mitigation

Insurance policies, or self-insurance funds, act as mechanisms to transfer or mitigate a portion of financial losses. This notebook focuses on **excess of loss policies**, where the insurer pays out only if the loss exceeds a certain threshold (deductible) and up to a specified limit (cover).

*   **Deductible ($d$)**: The initial amount of loss that the insured must bear for each event before the policy starts to pay out.
*   **Cover per Loss Event ($c$)**: The maximum amount the policy will pay out for a single loss event, once the deductible has been met.

For an individual gross loss event $X_i$, the **transferred amount** (payout from the policy) is given by the payout function $L_{d,c}(X_i)$. This function captures how much of a loss is covered by the policy based on the deductible and cover per event.

$$L_{d,c}(X_i) = \min(\max(X_i - d, 0), c)$$

Let's break down this formula:
*   $\max(X_i - d, 0)$: This part calculates the portion of the loss that exceeds the deductible $d$. If $X_i$ is less than or equal to $d$, this value is $0$, meaning no payout. If $X_i$ is greater than $d$, the payout starts from the amount exceeding $d$.
*   $\min(\dots, c)$: This part ensures that the payout does not exceed the maximum cover $c$ per loss event. So, even if $(X_i - d)$ is very large, the payout will be capped at $c$.

The **retained loss** for each event is simply the gross loss minus the transferred amount:
$$X_i^{\text{retained}} = X_i - L_{d,c}(X_i)$$

### 2.4 Aggregate Risk After Mitigation

For a series of $N$ simulated loss events, the **gross aggregate risk** is the sum of all individual gross losses: $\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.

The **total transferred losses** (total payout from the policy) is the sum of the payouts for each event: $\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{d,c}(X_i)$.

The **net aggregate risk ($S_{net}$)**, which represents the total financial exposure after accounting for the insurance mitigation, is calculated as the gross aggregate risk minus the total transferred losses. This directly shows the financial benefit of the mitigation strategy:

$$S_{net} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i - \sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{d,c}(X_i)$$

This formula, as outlined in the `PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook` [8], allows users to directly quantify the reduction in aggregate risk due to the applied mitigation policy.

## 4. Additional Notes or Instructions

### 4.1 Assumptions

*   **Independent Loss Events**: The simulation assumes that individual loss events are independent and identically distributed (IID), which simplifies the modeling of frequency and severity. In reality, operational losses can be correlated.
*   **Single Policy Type**: The simulation focuses on a simple per-event excess of loss policy, without considering aggregate limits, reinstatements, or more complex policy structures (e.g., quota share).
*   **No Premium Cost**: The calculation of net retained losses does not include the cost of the insurance premium. The focus is purely on the mitigation effect on gross losses.
*   **Perfect Mapping**: It is assumed that the insurance policy perfectly maps to the simulated risk category, without coverage mismatches or regulatory haircuts as discussed in the PRMIA Handbook [8].
*   **Synthetic Data Sufficiency**: The use of synthetic data is deemed sufficient for demonstrating the core concepts and learning outcomes.

### 4.2 Constraints

*   **Execution Performance**: The notebook must execute end-to-end within 5 minutes on a mid-specification laptop (8 GB RAM). This implies that complex, highly iterative, or large-scale simulations should be avoided or optimized.
*   **Open-Source Libraries**: Only open-source Python libraries available on PyPI are permitted for use.
*   **Code Documentation**: All major code steps must include both inline code comments and brief narrative markdown cells explaining `what` is being done and `why`.
*   **Data Quality Checks**: The notebook includes assertions for expected column names, data types, and primary-key uniqueness, and checks for missing values in critical fields. Summary statistics are logged for numeric columns.
*   **Sample Data**: An optional lightweight sample dataset (or default simulation parameters) should be provided to allow the notebook to run without user data input, ensuring immediate usability.

### 4.3 Customization Instructions

Users can easily customize the simulation by interacting with the `ipywidgets` controls.
*   To change the **number of simulated events**, adjust the `Number of Simulated Events (N)` slider.
*   To experiment with different **loss severity profiles**, select a `Loss Severity Distribution Type` from the dropdown and then adjust its corresponding parameters using the sliders (e.g., `Lognormal Mean`, `Pareto Shape`).
*   To understand the impact of **different mitigation policies**, modify the `Deductible (d)` and `Cover per Loss Event (c)` sliders. Observe how changes immediately affect the payout function plot, individual event payouts, and aggregated retained losses.
*   Users can re-run the relevant code cells after adjusting parameters to see the updated results and visualizations.
*   If interactive plots are not supported or desired, plots generated via `matplotlib` and `seaborn` will serve as static fallbacks. Users can save these plots as PNGs using standard `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()` functionality.
